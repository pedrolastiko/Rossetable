## What is it?

**Rosettable** is an interactive mapping and alignment tool for major cybersecurity and IT governance frameworks. It allows any security professional, architect, or compliance officer to instantly visualize cross-framework correspondences — without having to parse hundreds of pages of documentation.

The name is a deliberate play on words: **Rosetta** (the Stone that unlocked multiple languages at once) + **Table** (the alignment table that is the tool itself) + **-able** (actionable, usable).

## Features

- **🔍 Domain filtering** — display only the domains relevant to your context (Governance, Risk, Technical, Cyber Ops, AI…)
- **👁️ Column toggle** — hide any framework column with a single click to focus on what matters
- **🌙 Light / dark theme** — instant toggle between both display modes
- **🌐 Bilingual FR / EN** — the full interface and all control labels are translated using the official wording of each framework
- **📄 Single-file HTML** — no dependencies, no server, no installation. One `.html` file to open in any browser

## Usage

### Option 1 — GitHub Pages

```
https://pedrolastiko.github.io/rosettable/
```

### Option 2 — Intranet / internal portal

Copy the `index.html` file localy or directly into your internal portal. No external dependencies — the file is 100% self-contained.

## Technical Architecture

```
rosettable.html          ← single self-contained file
│
├── CSS                  ← light theme + dark theme (CSS custom properties)
├── HTML                 ← table structure, 17 rows × 7 framework columns
└── JavaScript
    ├── toggleTheme()    ← light / dark mode switch
    ├── toggleLanguage() ← FR / EN switch (full i18n)
    ├── toggleNorm()     ← column visibility by framework
    └── filterDomain()   ← row filtering by domain
```

**Dependencies:** none. Google Fonts loaded via CDN (optional — falls back to system fonts when offline).

---

## Translation Approach

All control labels are translated using the **official wording** of each framework — not paraphrases:

- **ISO 27001 / 42001** → Annex A control titles from the official English editions
- **NIST CSF 2.0** → Official category and subcategory labels
- **CIS Controls v8** → Official titles of the 18 CIS Controls
- **ITIL v4** → Official practice names (*Incident Management*, *Service Configuration Management*…)
- **COBIT 2019** → Official *Managed…* / *Ensure…* nomenclature

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add **SOC 2** (Trust Services Criteria)
- [ ] Add **DORA** (Digital Operational Resilience Act)
- [ ] Filtered matrix **PDF / Excel export**
- [ ] Maturity level indicator per control (CMMI-inspired)
